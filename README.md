# Weather-Journal App Project

This is my third project for Front-end Udacity Nanodegree.
The project is about to create an asynchronous web app that uses a Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.


## How to start

You need to have Node.js and npm locally installed. You can check that by running `node -v && npm -v` in terminal. This should result in two versions shown in terminal.

Then, you have to run `npm start` in order to run the express server locally.
